		<h5>Ideal Job: System Integration Officer</h5>
		<p class="pt-2">My ideal job is as System Integration Officer. Specifically, integration for people with 
		impairments such as vision or auditory as well as other disabilities. The integration officer’s
		main objective is to seamlessly integrate humans and technology by developing, managing and 
		maintaining integration systems. This requires the integration officer to have a broad range of
		knowledge across a variety of IT systems and combines elements of both front-end and back-end 
		development as well as an understanding of business practices and people. A strong focus on data
		manipulation and automated systems is essential for any position as an integration officer.</p>

		<p class="pt-2">As the system integration officer is required to work alongside all facets of information 
		technology, both technical and user focused, the skills necessary overlap with many of my
		Fighting Mongoose colleagues' ideal jobs. Adam (as a backend developer), Channon (as a 
		cyber security officer) and Daniel (as a systems administrator) all have technical focused ideal 
		jobs. A strong knowledge of database systems and structure is essential for all these occupations
		and technical aptitude in networked systems. Jorge and Maddie’s ideal jobs (both as IT support) 
		also share similar skill sets with integration officers as both roles require direct communication
		with user-end clients. The main difference of a systems integration officer compared to the ideal 
		jobs of my colleagues is that the integration officer is largely responsible for developing and 
		maintain the tools that allow both sides to work together. </p>

		<p class="pt-2">The most important baseline skills for integration officers, communication, ranks highly among my 
		colleagues. As communication is the most in demand baseline skill based on Burning Glass 
		Technologies’ data this is no surprise. Furthermore, required baseline skills in problem solving, 
		teamwork and organisational skills also rank highly amongst my colleagues and myself. Perhaps my 
		required baselines skills lean more towards Maddie and Jorge’s ideal jobs as both integration 
		officers and IT support staff communicate heavily with user-end clients and business management. </p>

		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">As the required skills were similar to those of my colleagues, a wide variety of skills is essential
		to assimilating to a team environment. Acting as an integration officer requires me to work alongside
		both front-end and back-end teams as well as finding solutions with clients and business entities.</p>
