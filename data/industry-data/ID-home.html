		<h5>Reflection of Data</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">The above data is a good reflection as to our Ideal Jobs skill requirements and the skill sets that are sought after from job listings. It does not however
		denote the skills that each individual will achieve from the study path they are undergoing to achieve their Ideal Jobs. From the above data we can see as a team we
		have the Generic Skills covered, with some IT Skills lacking to some in their Ideal Jobs that are covered by others. Graphic Design was the only
		real downfall however as stated previously the data above is not a reflection of skills each person would have acquired. So as an end note the team we have put together
		THE FIGHTING MONGOOSES will have no problems conquering any task.</p>
