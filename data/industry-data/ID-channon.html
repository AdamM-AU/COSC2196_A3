		There are many different fillable roles in the field of cyber security and i am yet to decide exactly what path i wish to take however most skills are transferable so getting the
		basics of what i need to learn out of the way initially will guide me further as to what role i wish to take. I am currently liking the outlook of Cryptographer, Security engineer
		and Penetration tester.</p>

		<h5>Skills for Job</h5>
		<p class="pt2 pb-3">
		The skills required are both hard and soft skills currently i am working on getting the hard skills done by completing a course through RMIT i should be able to atleast have
		the basic underpinning to the knowledge i need. From there will look into certifications if needed however a general understanding i find to be more imperative at this point in time.</p>
