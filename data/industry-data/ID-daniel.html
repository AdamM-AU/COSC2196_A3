		<h5>Job title - Systems Administrator</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">	Employer Demand: Systems Administrator was 8th on the list of Burning Glass data on Top Job Titles listed for Information Technology,
			out of 25. The most in demand job title of Solutions Architect had 45% more postings.</p>

		<h5>Skill Set Required:</h5><br>
		<h6>General Skills</h6>
		<ul class="pt-2 pb-3">
			<li>Organisational and planning skills. </li>
			<li>Conceptual and analytical skills. </li>
			<li>Problem Solving and interpersonal skills. </li>
			<li>Verbal and written communication skills. </li>
		</ul>

		<h6>IT Skills</h6>
		<ul class="pt-2 pb-3">
			<li>Windows server and workstation operating systems (Administration).</li>
			<li>SQL Server databases (Administration).</li>
			<li>Microsoft Exchange / Exchange Online / Office 365 (Administration).</li>
			<li>Networking and server trends and standards / Network management.</li>
			<li>Customer service skills / PC Support.</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="pt-2">Most of the General skills in my required skill set ranked at the very top in terms of demand from employers with Communication, Problem Solving, Organisational
		and Writing rounding out the top four. Planning was number seven and Analytical skills were the least in demand with only 7% of the demand of Communication skills.<br />
		The three highest ranked general skills which are not in my required skill set are Team Work / Collaboration, Troubleshooting and Detail Oriented.</p>

		<p class="pt-2">A couple of the IT-specific skills in my required skill set rank highly in terms of demand from employers including SQL that is the most in demand skill and
		Windows at number four on the list. Customer service, Technical Support and Microsoft Office were further down the list. I couldnâ€™t see Networking on the list.<br />
		The three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in my required skill set are JavaScript, Java and Project Management.</p>

		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Having looked at the Burning Glass data, my opinion of Systems Administrator as an ideal job has not changed. This is because there still appears to be adequate
		demand for the job and very high demand for most of the general skills required and sufficient demand for the IT skills required. This leads me to believe switching jobs in
		the future within IT would be quite feasible with my required skill set being varied and overall in demand. Beginning a career in Systems Administration should not be a
		burden on future job prospects and will in fact leave me with a strong foundational skill set. </p>
