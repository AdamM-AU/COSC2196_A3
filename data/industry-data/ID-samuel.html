		<h5>Job title - Systems Integration Officer</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">My intended career is as a Systems Integration Officer. A Systems Integration Officer specialises in bringing together several systems 
		to function together. Specifically, to ensure seamless integration of human interaction and technology. While not particularly focusing on any one field, 
		a broad range of knowledge of different systems is in order, both technical and interpersonal. Many of these skills are ranked highly on Burning Glass 
		Technologies’ labour insight findings (2018).</p>

		<p class="pt-5">While the position as Systems Integration Officer does not appear on the top 25 list on Burning Glass Technologies’ findings, the skills necessary 
		are highly transferrable to other roles. Pursuing a career as a Systems Integration officer still affords the opportunity towards a variety of other roles.</p>

		<p class="pt-2">Predictably, the broad range of skills necessary for my ideal job match many of the skills of the ideal jobs of my colleagues in The Fighting Mongooses.
		Furthermore, because an integration officer’s role is to provide seamless interaction between humans and technology, many of the skills help with the transitions between each of my colleagues’ roles.</p>

		<p class="pt-2">The most important technical skills for integration officers, SQL and Java is similar to the roles that Adam (as a back-end developer), Channon (as a cyber security officer) and Daniel 
		(as a system administrator) a required.  Skills in business management and analysis are similar to Jorge’s (as IT support) ideal job. Maddie’s (as IT support) required skills in customer service are also 
		synonymous with my ideal role. What separates my ideal job from others is skills in SAP which deals largely in automated systems which are essential in technological integration.</p>

		<p class="pt-2">The most important baseline skills for integration officers, communication, ranks highly among my colleagues. As communication is the most in demand baseline skill based on Burning Glass Technologies’ 
		data this is no surprise. Furthermore, required baseline skills in problem solving, teamwork and organisational skills also rank highly amongst my colleagues and myself. Perhaps my required baselines skills lean more 
		towards Maddie and Jorge’s ideal jobs as both integration officers and IT support staff communicate heavily with user-end clients and business management.</p>

		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">As the required skills were similar to those of my colleagues, a wide variety of skills is essential to assimilating to a team environment. Acting as an integration officer requires me to work alongside 
		both front-end and back-end teams as well as finding solutions with clients and business entities.</p>
