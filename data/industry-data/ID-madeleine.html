		<h5>Job title: IT Support Officer</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">My ideal job selection is not listed in the Burning Glass data as one of the top job titles. 
		This is surprising to me as I would have predicted that IT support jobs would be very common in this industry. 
		Perhaps the Burning Glass data is not categorising the most common job titles but rather the most valued or highly paid job titles. 
		If that is the case then it is understandable why IT support workers are not listed here. 
		Unfortunately, it is very unclear what the Burning Glass data is really about as it does not explain itself. 
		I did try to look into finding better or clearer data on this topic but could only find predictions for the most in demand IT jobs or the highest paying IT jobs, 
		no data on what is realistically in demand or common. I chose to use the Burning Glass data here anyway.</p>

		<h6>Here are the IT skills that are listed in the Burning Glass data that I will require in my ideal job, listed from most to least in demand:</h6>
		<ul class="pt-2 pb-3">
			<li>Technical support</li>
			<li>Customer service</li>
			<li>Microsoft Office </li>
		</ul>

		</ul>
		
		<h6>Here are the generic skills that are listed in the Burning Glass data that I will require in my ideal job, listed from most to least in demand:</h6>

		<h5>Having looked at the Burning Glass data, has my opinion of my ideal job changed? Why or why not?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">No, my opinion has not changed. The skills required for my ideal job are still much more than I have now, 
		so there is plenty of improvement for me to make. There is also no need for me to work under a highly paid or highly sought-after job title if I enjoy the work otherwise. 
		As far as I can tell there are plenty of IT support jobs available despite the data supplied by Burning Glass. 
		Plus, if I choose to work for a great organisation like SANE Australia in the future then I will be very grateful.</p>
