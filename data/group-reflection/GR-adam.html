		<h5>What went well?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2">In the beginning I was curious on how events would unfold. Initially the group was quiet as we grouped up when first 
		instructed to do so by Tim. But as the group assignment start date was nearing the group sprung to life and has been at full swing ever since. 
		The team consists of members with varying skill sets and levels of knowledge.</p>
		<p class="pt-2">All the team members got along with each other and worked well in the group; support was always offered to assist the other team members if they required it.</p>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">I am very proud to be a member of <q>The Fighting Mongooses</q>.</p>
		
		<h5>What could be improved?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2">This question was a little hard to answer as I could not really recall anything that needed to be improved, except our lack of 
		knowledge on where people in the team were located and their time zones. I personally just assumed everyone was in Victoria. Which caught most of us 
		off guard with daylight savings time and scheduling conflicts.</p>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Yes, Assumptions make life harder, its best to assume nothing.</p>

		<h5>At least one thing that was surprising?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2">It was surprising to me the willingness of each team member to assist another as much as possible even on tasks they 
		were not assigned to work on, which I thought was great as it clearly shows how effective our team was.</p>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Another thing that surprised me is just how well we got along, just like we already had known each other for years.</p>
		
		<h5>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Teams work well when everyone gets along and shows willingness to learn and achieve the goals as a team and not as an individual.</p>
