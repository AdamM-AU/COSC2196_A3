		<h5>What went well?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2">As a group, we all agree that from the start we were all eager and ready to go. The initial group forming was done quickly and 
		once the introductions were done and the communication started. Being lucky in the selection of our members from an open invitation we ended up having 
		people from all backgrounds with varying skill sets.</p>

		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Tasks were broken down to skill sets that suited each person the best we could, which gave us a quick start with the content being 
		completed at an early stage for everyone to read over and collaborate on. All of us got along like we have had known each other for years and the support 
		each of had given each other was beyond what any of us initially expected. We are all proud of what was achieved and could not be any happier with being 
		part of <q>The Fighting Mongooses</q>.</p>

		<h5>What could be improved?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2">This was a hard one for all of us to decide on as we all agree that overall, the commitment of the group and what was achieved was phenomenal. 
		There were only minor issues in hindsight mainly the commencement of daylight savings and with the scheduling of meetings within them. However, it only affected 
		the scheduling of one meeting.</p>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">With the use of teams and our out of band communication, there was usually always one group member available, however sometimes specific 
		team members that needed to collaborate on a task were not online at the same time, so the reply process was slower, this was also only a minor issue.</p>
		
		<h5>At least one thing that was surprising?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Surprising to all, was just how well it went with the willingness of everyone to contribute. The support we gave each other even with 
		items outside the scope of the assignment, such as sharing knowledge and experiences. This sharing helped us grow as a team.</p>
		
		<h5>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">What we all took away from this varies between each team member. However, we all agree that a positive work environment and good team morale 
		is the key to success. Seeing the hard work each team member would put into a task, made us all want to work harder to achieve the same level of dedication. 
		There is no I in team and when all the cogs are working together, the weight is lighter and easier to move.</p>
