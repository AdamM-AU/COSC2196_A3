		<h5>What went well?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">As this was the first time I’d worked in a group 100% remotely I thought the whole process went relatively smoothly and better than I’d 
			expected. In particular I thought the assignment was broken down well and the workload was distributed evenly and efficiently. Everyone seemed to naturally
			move into the roles that suited them best.</p>

		<h5>What could be improved?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">I think in regards to communication and meetings we improved over time once we got used to the procedures, software and assignment requirements
			and were more familiar with each other. For my part I could have done more preparation going into meetings to avoid needless stress because I wasn’t as
			organised as I could have been. I probably should have read the assignment spec earlier and reread it more often so I had more confidence contributing
			during recorded meetings and not come off as skittish or flippant as I’m afraid I did.</p>
		
		<h5>At least one thing that was surprising?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">I was surprised by the progress we made so quickly and the lack of any friction or even small disagreements. All in all it was a pleasant
			experience. I thought it was going to be a more stressful ordeal than it was though that’s not to say it wasn’t challenging.</p>
		
		<h5>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">The initial foreign feeling fades over time - quicker than I anticipated. Communication is definitely as important as it was made out to be
			going into this group assignment. The sooner questions are asked and issues are raised the better. It’s easy to understand that without open and frequent
			dialogue things could fall apart quickly and deadlines easily missed.</p>
