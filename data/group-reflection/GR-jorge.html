		<h5>What went well?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">We had a really good start, everyone was very committed to the assessment and happy to contribute in the best way they could, the team 
		came together and quickly we started to delegating task to each member. Everyone worked really well for being the first time i work in an online course and made me really happy 
		that the team members I worked are willing to help others and share their knowledge with others.</p>
		
		<h5>What could be improved?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Think there is not too much to improve, there would be a few things in my opinion, like for example delegating specific task’s or maybe working
		in teams, just in case if someone has a problem on how to do something specific so the other person can help right away be able to solve the issue much quicker.</p>

		<h5>At least one thing that was surprising?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">How good was working with everyone. I felt like each team member was good at what they had to do. And how easy was to communicate 
		in between us and help each other. Everybody came together really well and with a good attitude to do the best they could. While others offered their time 
		to explain things or arrange meetings.</p>
		
		<h5>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Working in teams was great, I got to learn more from other people who could explain me how to solve some of the issues I encounter along the w
		ay when I was doing my research.  and the same for the other team members. If there was something, we didn’t know how to solve it.
		We brainstorm the situation until we find a solution.</p>
