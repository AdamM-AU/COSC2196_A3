		<h5>What went well?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">I believe everything went well from the initial group getting together to getting the task done. The fact we organised a group early and from the get-go everyone
		was keen to be working as part of the group. We organized a plan right at the start and everyone had tasks set they were happy to complete which made it easy to accomplish our task.</p>

		<h5>What could be improved?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">In terms of improvement would only be minor things, the only real drawback was time differences however we still managed to work around this and have everyone
		collaborate. When putting together meetings it may have become an issue if further meetings were required.</p>

		<h5>At least one thing that was surprising?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">What I found really surprising was the ease of how it all came together, when matching 6 different people together and giving them a task with no prior knowledge
		of each other the whole process went smother then ever imagined.</p>

		<h5>At least one thing that you have learned about groups?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">I have learnt working in this group especially that you can rely on others and you donâ€™t need to take all the stress on yourself. Working in group environments
		previously often there would be unresolved differences and clashing opinions. The key to this success was the communication and the agreeance of the path we were taking, and any
		concerns were deliberated on and successfully concluded.</p>
