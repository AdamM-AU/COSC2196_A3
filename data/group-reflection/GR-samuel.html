		<h5>What went well?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">From the start everyone was eager to get on task and I feel we all got along well together.
		I initially had concerns about joining a team solely online and remote. All my concerns were alleviated as everyone
		collaborated and made time to work effectively together. Our team has six members all with varied levels of knowledge 
		and skills and we were able to find roles that suited our abilities and help out other team members where necessary.</p>
		
	
		<h5>What could be improved?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Our team communicated quite clearly and there was little confusion over our direction. We set most
		of our tasks and planning done in the early stages of the assignment. We initially did not take into account time zones 
		and daylight-saving time changes. This had the potential of causing scheduling issues with interstate team members however, 
		the interstate team members were flexible, and we managed to quickly find a solution. Even though for this assignment 
		the daylight-saving time change only caused a minor inconvenience for some, we should perhaps be more aware of such issues 
		in future assignments.</p>
		
		
		<h5>At least one thing that was surprising?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Everyone was extremely supportive of each other and helped out however they could. Everyone was sincere
		and genuine in helping each other. One particular occasion of note was when Adam offered his own time on top of the assignment
		to teach other team members about using Git and GitHub.</p>
		
		
		<h5>At least one thing that you have learned about groups.</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Morale and a positive work environment matter a great deal. Because all team members responded positively 
		to each other, everyone did their tasks willingly. I genuinely wanted to achieve the best results for my team and worked hard.
		I feel others did the same.</p>
