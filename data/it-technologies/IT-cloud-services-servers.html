		<h4>Clouds, Services &amp; Servers</h4>
		<h6 class="pb-3">By Jorge Esteban (s3874914)</h6>

		<h5>What does it do?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Cloud computing in a very simple way is the access   management and storage of data from anywhere at any time:  
		cloud computing helps to store files and access programs from remote locations,  this data can be access using a smartphone connected 
		to the internet or a computer.  cloud computing is service   use by many companies nowadays.  the company or user   pays a fee to have 
		access to a wide variety of resources cloud computing offers.  for example:  a person can use the cloud to store and backup data, by 
		transferring this data over the internet to and offsite cloud storage system it would make it accessible from any location at any time.</p>
		
		<h6>What's the state of this technology?</h6>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">The state of cloud computing is very bright according to an article from “critical case.com” cloud computing in 2019 
		is expected to be around the 206,2 billion dollar industry.  more and more companies have become aware that cloud computing provides the 
		resources that companies required. Without the company to invest massive amounts of money in creating and maintain their own data network.</p>
		
		<h6>What can be done now?</h6>
		<p class="pt-2">Cloud computing can offer a wide amount of services for example infrastructure as a service (Iaas) , software as service (Saas).</p>
		<p class="pt-2">As for a Iaas  this is a service that cloud computing companies offer, which deliver virtualized computing resources to organizations 
		via the internet. this is one of the main types of cloud services expected to have a reach of 40 billion in 2019.  the second main type of cloud 
		computing service is SaaS,  this is a software distribution service in which the provider hosts the applications for customers and make them available 
		to these customers over the internet , companies using this Saas don’t have to worry to install or run applications into their own systems , everything 
		is based on the cloud . This eliminates the costs of purchasing and maintaining hardware.</p>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Platform as service (Paas) : this is service for developers that help develop or build applications.  it provides all the 
		tools and resources the developer needs to work in the project and also to work with others. Now with this service developers can access to 
		their projects anywhere from a web browser because the development project is not hosted locally. This is a great tool because it also helps 
		to collaborate with other people around the globe and work faster. In conclusion with IaaS, SaaS and Pass. Cloud computing is a robust and 
		very capable system that is very capable to handle any task.  and would improve productivity and save money.</p>
		
		<h6>What is likely to be done soon?</h6>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">We can expect that more companies eventually would shut down their own data centers and turn to cloud computing giving the 
		enormous amount of resources it provides and the  low cost it represent compared to  maintain their own data center.  as well we can expect cloud 
		computing to be more integrated into our daily life. One aspect of cloud computing that is starting to grow so fast is in the video game sector. 
		there is already a few companies that provide cloud gaming google with google stadia and Nvidia with GeForce now. These two offer users a pay subscription 
		that would allow players to play their games on demand from their phones tablet or pc ’s as long there are connected to the internet.  
		by using the processing power of their data centers, they can stream the gaming content to the player to any location. This is likely to be the next step 
		for cloud computing.</p>
		
		<h5>What is the likely impact?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2">There would be positive and negative impacts. On the positive side cloud computing has help companies to hire the computing infrastructure
		they need saving them money. These benefits include stable services and accessing to new software applications every time there are new updates.  
		It would increase flexibility, the way how people work.  now people can work remotely or just keep on track from what other people are doing.    
		Collaboration with more people would be greatly expanded sharing or accessing information with a large group of people would increase productivity.</p>
		<p class="pt-2"> I believe that cloud computing would bring a lot of benefits to everyone that uses this technology, it would save time and make work more 
		flexible and people can be more productive.</p>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">On the other hand.  there would be negative impacts on how cloud computing would be storing vast amounts of consumer data information. 
		Making it a perfect target for hackers who would try to disrupt the service or steal information.  but is not only these factors that make cloud computing. 
		A vulnerable technology, there is also down time like what happened back in 2017 when Amazon servers went down were the mistake of one company employee 
		debugging and issue with the billing system accidentally took more servers offline then the error created a domino effect. That cost around 150 million dollars.</p>
		
		<h6>What is likely to change?</h6>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">This technology would be evolving and be putting to use in other technologies to work, like for example machine learning. 
		Other aspect is the reinforce of security and data privacy as more people and companies would be more watchful on how their information is being manage.  
		Another change that we would see soon, would be the obsolescence of certain jobs and the creation of new ones. Once companies turn to cloud services some 
		IT positions inside the company would be cut down, as all the services, software installation and network maintenance would be ceased to exist inside the company.</p>
		
		<h5>How will this affect you?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">This effect is already happening in large number of people’s around the world now services like google drive, droop box or Microsoft 
		one drive come for free or pre-installed in mobile devices. So, people can get into the cloud services.  Other platforms like Facebook or YouTube have a 
		great influence in our daily life's. We have access to information in seconds and share information with other people around the globe. We have become more 
		informed thanks to these technologies. There are many areas in were cloud computing would have and affect in our life's driverless cars, healthcare, education.</p>
		
		<h6>What would be different for most people with cloud computing?</h6>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Cloud computing is a service, provided by a company. It means that we the people are being moved into use these services.  
		These services come on monthly fees or yearly fees. So, we would be attaching to a subscription scheme. No longer we would be the owners of the software but only users.</p>
		
		<h6>What this would be different for us people?</h6>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Cloud computing relies on the premise of much faster and always online access to our files. Which it means we are putting the 
		trust into this companies to store and protect our sensitive information.  Our data can be more exposed than ever before.  For most people this 
		would be a great tool to work in many different areas as we can now work or collaborate and share our information with more people than ever before, 
		new projects or ideas would become much easier or faster to create. New jobs in the IT sector would be created and new IT innovations.</p>
