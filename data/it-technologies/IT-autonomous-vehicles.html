		<h4>Autonomous Vehicles</h4>
		<h6 class="pb-3">By Madeleine Dupree (s3879009)</h6>
		
		<h5>What do autonomous vehicles do?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Autonomous vehicles are self-driving or computer-driven forms of transport - usually cars- that do not require the 
		full control of a human or none at all to operate safely on the road. In 2016 the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) created a standard 
		for Levels of Driving Automation J3016 (SAE International that include levels 0 through to 5. Here is their original description of these levels:<br /><br />

		</p>
		
		<h6>What's the state of this technology?</h6>
		<p class="pt-2">Driverless cars are capable of using a wide range of technologies in order to function safely in a constantly changing traffic environment. 
		Here is some of the most up to date technology:</p>

		<ul class="pt-2 pb-3">
			<li>High resolution cameras are placed on every side of the care and are used to get a 360-degree view of the surroundings. 
			These cameras vary in their field of view, some being wide and having a short range, others being narrow with a longer range. 
			Cameras create a great 2D picture of what is around the car but cannot provide depth of vision for the computer to understand. 
			Additionally, cameras are quite limited in their effectiveness in dark, dusty, foggy, snowy or rainy environments. 
			High resolution cameras must be used alongside other technologies in order to give cars autonomous functions.</li>
			<li>Radar is the use of radio waves to detect the location and speed of other objects - usually cars. 
			This is done by sending out pulses of radio waves that bounce back off of objects. 
			The returning radio waves are then sensed by the car and provide information on the proximity of surrounding objects. 
			Radar can also be used by boats, ships, aircrafts and meteorologist to detect weather changes.</li>
			<li>Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) is the use of lasers to create a 3D image of the earth or objects. 
			These lasers are fast and invisible and function similarly to radar.  However, LiDAR detects much more information so provides 
			more opportunity for car autonomy.</li>
			<li>Thermal cameras are used to detect living things such as people and animals in a traffic environment. 
			This can aid greatly in developing safety measures for driverless cars because the safety of humans should be the number on priority. </li>
			<li>Ultrasound is similar to radar in that it sends out signals to measure how quickly they bounce back to get an idea of how far away objects are. 
			This can be very accurate at short distances in clear environments. For this reason, ultrasound is often used in cars to aid with self-parking.  </li>
			<li>Global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) or global positioning systems (GPS) are used to approximate where the car is on the globe. 
			This can be accurate up to a few meters or more. While this is not a new technology, it is still used by the autonomous vehicles made today.  </li>
			<li>Inertial measurement units (IMUs) are used to identify the position and movements of the car, where it has been and where it is now.  </li>
		</ul>
		
		<h6>What can be done now?</h6>
		<p class="pt-2">The most well-known and advanced technology in this area seems to be Waymo One. Waymo One is Google’s sister company that launched its first commercial autonomous 
		taxi service within the metro Phoenix area in December 2018. The service was first provided to just a few select customers who were a part of the Early Rider Program. 
		These cars were always accompanied by a driver at the time but now that the Waymo One service is available to the rest of the public in the metro Phoenix area, 
		some of the autonomous cars are completely driverless. The Early Rider Program is still in progress in order to provide early feature access and to collect 
		valuable research on these features. Waymo One is considered to be at level 4 in driving automation as it is still restricted to the Phoenix area and still require 
		drivers some/most of the time for safety but essentially do all of the driving themselves.</p>

		<p class="pt-2">As far as autonomous cars that are available to the public, Tesla is probably leading the way. They already provide cars that are well and truly 
		classified as level 2, some have level 3 functions and in some cases level 4 driving on highways and more. However, these cars are said to be capable of 
		level 5 autonomy after some software updates.</p>

		<p class="pt-2">‘I remain confident that we will have the basic functionality for level 5 autonomy complete this year’
		(Elon Musk talks Autopilot and Level 5 Autonomy at China AI conference, Teslacn 2020).</p>

		<p class="pt-2">With Waymo One already having level 5 autonomous cars and Tesla stating that they plan to reach level 5 autonomy this year, 
		it seems that autonomous cars could become quite popular within the next three years or even as soon as next year. 
		The prices of the currently available Teslas in Australia range from around $79,556 for the cheapest Model 3 or up to $187,373 for the dearest Model X. 
		However, the upcoming Cybertruck that will release in 2021 will be available for as low as $39,900 (Tesla 2020). 
		It is noted that while this is Tesla’s Australian website, there is no clear statement on whether these are US prices or AU prices, 
		while the specs on these vehicles are indeed in US values - not AU - and other searches on these cars, external to Tesla, suggest that these prices may be in USD. 
		Either way, the prices of these vehicles seem quite reasonable and possibly quite accessible to the middle-class citizen here in Australia.</p>

		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">While the service is on pause at the moment, there is a driverless bus service that runs the Geraldton Foreshore in Western Australia 
		that offers a 30-minute drive next to the beach. It is called the Intellibus and it is completely driverless, though does still have two people on board 
		who can take over the driving if necessary (RAC 2020)</p>
		
		<h5>What is the likely impact?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2">There are and always have been many safety concerns related to autonomous vehicles or any technology that has control over human lives. 
		Placing our lives in the hands of robots that do not possess morals to guide them is unnerving to say the least. 
		There are many questions that may need to be answered before the general public can feel comfortable around these machines. 
		For example, are pedestrians always safe around these cars? Will level 5 cars be able to ensure the safety of the people inside? 
		Are these cars more or less safe than human-driven cars? There may also be moral questions such as, can the car’s choices 
		(e.g. parking preference or speed) be altered to suit the owner or passengers? Should they be altered? Who is at fault when these cars make mistakes, 
		the driver or the manufacturer?</p>
		
		<p class="pt-2">Another thing to consider is security. Autonomous cars are run by a computer or several computers which leads to the possibility of hacking concerns. 
		While the manufacturers will most likely have considered this thoroughly, can they guarantee that their systems will not be compromised? 
		Autonomous cars that use satellite or GPS may raise concerns about location security. Both physical safety and cyber safety will need to be considered 
		when developing or purchasing autonomous cars.</p>

		<p class="pt-2">These cars would surely function better if the roads were catered to autonomous cars, rather than human-driven cars. 
		If driverless cars become popular there could be major changes in how roads are initially made or updated. If the road communicates with the car rather than just 
		the car detecting the road then this could lead to more efficiency and better safety precautions. Our roads could look very different if autonomous driving 
		becomes mainstream.</p>

		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Tesla is well known for their electric cars which could lead to more sustainable options such as solar power. If driverless cars are run on electricity 
		rather than petrol, that could be a big step in the direction of reducing the currently negative impact that cars have on the earth.</p>
		
		<h6>Which people will be most affected and how?</h6>
		<p class="pt-2">Many people could be affected by the rise of autonomous vehicles because so many people use cars. Anyone who drives a car or who walks the streets could 
		experience a neutral/positive benefit due to the number of car accidents that may be prevented by driverless vehicles. Anyone who drives an autonomous vehicle 
		for work may end up saving time or money in the long run. Those who make autonomous vehicles could make quite the profit on these amazing new cars. 
		Anyone who takes public transport could benefit from busses or trains that are more likely to be on time due to calculations, rather than predictions. 
		Could autonomous trains one day save lives due to rigorous safety features and reducing the number of people who die on train tracks?</p>

		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">I think autonomous cars could be most beneficial for people are blind, vision impaired, injured, elderly, disabled or otherwise unable to drive. 
		Driverless cars could potentially provide these people more access to their communities, friends, family, appointments and other needs. 
		By providing a reliable, safe and trustworthy system of transport, these people could have longer and more enriched lives.</p>
		
		<h6>Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h6>
		<p class="pt-2">If driverless cars do become more popular, there is the potential for more jobs to be made and some jobs to be lost. 
		For example, Uber drivers, taxi drivers, bus drivers, delivery services or even train and tram drivers could lose their jobs in the near/distant future 
		due to the promised safety features that driverless cars have. These cars do not tire, do not make human mistakes, do not drink drive, 
		do not get distracted by mobile phones and do not speed by default. They also are able to predict the most efficient route and overtake when it is useful to do so. 
		This means that these cars have the potential to be safer, quicker and cheaper than human-driven cars in many settings.</p>

		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Alternatively, more jobs could be made through the manufacturing, maintenance and research that is put into these cars. With our ever-changing roads, 
		these cars may require ongoing updates to ensure that the computers know what their surroundings mean and how to respond safely. 
		At this stage, software updates require human intelligence and intervention, therefore possibly more jobs. If these cars become mainstream 
		then people will want to purchase new models with different features and different looks, this will require more people working towards these goals 
		and selling these cars at new dealerships. This could also mean that our current popular cars become less mainstream, leading to lost jobs at other dealerships. 
		It is hard to say how this may look in the future.</p>
		
		<h5>How will this affect you, your family or your friends?</h5>
		<p class="pt-2">I imagine that autonomous vehicles aren’t going to impact my life much in the next three years as I am not planning on purchasing one in that time. 
		I also do not currently have a job that requires that I drive anywhere so I probably will not be offered a driverless vehicle for work purposes. 
		I do not take public transport very much so I am unlikely to use an autonomous bus. I prefer to drive myself and avoid the cost of delivery where I can 
		so I would not likely utilise driverless taxis, Ubers or delivery services more than I do now. If autonomous cars become popular in my area then I may be safer 
		on the road or as a pedestrian due to a potential ripple effect but other than that I imagine my driving experience will not change much at all in the next three years. 
		If autonomous vehicles prove to be safer than human-driven vehicles then I will at least appreciate their growing presence in our society.</p>

		<p class="pt-2">I don’t know if any of my family members or friends wish to purchase an autonomous vehicle in the near future so I cannot predict if they will experience 
		much of an impact from these new cars, much like myself.</p>

		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">My partner has expressed interest in the Cybertruck but has a fairly new car himself which he barely uses so he probably will not choose to 
		purchase the Cybertruck at this stage. If he did though, I would be pretty curious to experience what it is like. I think it could be exciting for any new buyer 
		and their friends to see how it works, how smooth the driving is and how safe it would feel.</p>
