		<h5>Motivation</h5>
		<p class="pt-2">The motivation for this application was to empower users of social media to take back control of their online presence and educate them on the 
		security and privacy issues associated with their use of social media.</p>
		
		<p class="pt-2">Humans are social creatures, and the digital era did not change this, but it did vastly change the way we communicate. Using social media, 
		we have instant access to billions of people, and we have new ways of interaction. But social media has privacy and security risks, when not used appropriately. 
		It is used also by criminals for fraud, gathering business intelligence, stealing sensitive information, etc. (Tayouri 2015).</p>
		
		<p class="pt-2">The rise of the social web has traditionally been accompanied by privacy concerns (Netter, Herbst & Pernul 2011).  Many people may not be aware 
		of how much personally identifiable information about themselves they are sharing online to the public and how secure their various social media accounts are, 
		or how vulnerable they truly are. How a person has their social media accounts security and privacy settings setup makes a substantial difference in determining 
		how much information about them is available to anyone online and how secure their account is in terms of being vulnerable to hacking or other interference or breaches.</p>
		
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Because we are passionate about privacy and security awareness, we wanted to put users back in control of their social media/digital presence and 
		minimize personal data exposure. We believe this application will be useful in achieving that aim.</p>
