		<h5>Overview</h5>
		<p class="pt-2">Our teams project idea is a mobile application, this application will scan the user’s privacy and security settings on Facebook 
		and other social media platforms to allow the user to be more secure and private. The application will work by the user giving us permission to access 
		their social media accounts, once this access has been granted our server side application will analyse the users social media accounts when directed 
		by the user, once the analysis has been completed the mobile application using push requests will notify the user if their account or accounts are in 
		our opinion not secure or as private as they should be. As social media platforms attempt to minimize how much external applications can access or change 
		via their API’s our application will need to use a combination of API calls and web scraping of the user’s profile to accomplish this task.</p>
		
		<p class="pt-2">For example checking a user’s Facebook account using a combination of web scraping and API calls, our application should be able 
		to determine if a user has posts set to public, pictures publicly available besides the required profile and cover photo, has personally identifiable 
		information shared to the public such as employment details, email address, phone numbers, etc., determine what applications have access to their social 
		media accounts which may pose a security or privacy risk and check for chainmail posts.</p>
		
		<p class="pt-2">Users will then be given access to tutorial videos which will be hosted on our own webserver, which will guide them step by step to 
		correct the security and/or privacy concerns our application has found, these concerns will also be explained to the user in simple terms that the 
		non-technical person can understand.</p>
		
		<p class="pt-2">Additionally, the application will also notify the user of privacy agreement and terms of service changes with their social media 
		accounts registered with our application and supplying the user with more insight on how these changes may affect them or others.</p>
		
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Initially the application will be written to target the privacy and security settings of a user’s Facebook accounts, 
		with the long-term goal of also supporting Twitter, Instagram, WeChat, and others in the future.</p>
