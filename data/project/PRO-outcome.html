		<h5>Outcome</h5>
		<p class="pt-2">If our project is successful, the users of our application will have their social media security and privacy settings aligned with their own personal 
		preference and be only sharing what information they deem fit to the appropriate audiences.</p>

		<p class="pt-2">Users will be confident that their use of social media is as safe and secure as their social media provider allows and be aware their accounts are as 
		safe as possible from interference and their data and personal information is secure and protected. Hopefully, users will be educated in the risks associated with social 
		media use and the appropriate settings and measures to take place to mitigate those risks, allowing them to enjoy the benefits of social media and avoid the numerous pitfalls.</p>

		<p class="pt-2">With our application monitoring for changes that social media platforms may make to any security or privacy policies or practices, users will also be protected 
		into the future and have no need to be anxious about any adverse changes going unnoticed.</p>

		<p class="pt-2">The original problem of poor social media security and privacy will be solved, and user's awareness and education will be improved.</p>

		<p class="pt-2">The potential drawbacks are the need to have the application running in the background to allow it to provide notifications about setting changes and possibly 
		the need for the application to be updated periodically.</p>

		<p class="pt-2">As the application may not be able to make all the changes to a user’s social media account or accounts itself due to the limitations imposed by the social 
		media platforms to their APIs and will have to rely on the user successfully following tutorials, human error may mean some changes may not actually take affect but the user 
		will think they have, lulling them into a  false sense of security, however in this case the application will notify the user again, the user may give up making the changes 
		if the task is too laborious or complicated which it sometimes can be when navigating social media security settings - they aren’t always the easiest to locate.</p>

		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Another potential obstacle we anticipate is keeping up with the changes in a timely manner and having new tutorial videos ready. The tutorial videos 
		must also be easy to follow and aimed at novices which will need testing - the videos could seem easy to follow to ourselves who have IT experience, but we may leave some 
		people behind. We will keep this in mind during development to make sure the app is effective. With appropriate measures and safeguards we believe this application has the 
		potential to make a real difference in improving social media security and privacy, so it can be used safely, and be the enjoyable experience it set out to be, without the risk.</p>
