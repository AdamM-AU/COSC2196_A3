		<h5>Tools and Technology</h5>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Our project will be requiring several technologies, tools, and resources to accomplish our project goal. These will be hosted virtual servers, 
		devices for testing our application, software packages, software development kits, and application programming interface documentation.</p>
		
		<h6>Virtual Servers</h6>
		<p class="pt-2">Virtual servers will be used for the backend applications that will be processing the user’s Security, Privacy and Sharing Settings using a combination 
		of API calls and web scraping that will be too complex for a mobile device to accomplish with any real speed.</p>
		<p class="pt-2">Some of these will be used as webservers to host various tutorial videos and support pages, we have chosen to use NGINX as our webserver software due 
		to its ability to serve larger visitor numbers than Apache2.</p>
		<p class="pt-2">A combination of PostgreSQL and MongoDB database servers will be used by both webpage content and backend application data storage.</p>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">AWS will also be used for end point delivery to the mobile application and for inbound feeds from the social media platforms to avoid security 
		protection systems in place that may block our access as suspicious activity due to the high volume of traffic.</p>

		<h6>Devices & Testing Platforms</h6>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">To adequately test our application, we will need access to both a compatible Android device and a compatible Apple device. However, in the early 
		stages of development we can use the development environment SDKs virtual machines to test the basic functionality and review the design of the application.</p>
		
		<h6>Development Environment</h6>
		<p class="pt-2">Android Application - Android Studio will be used to build the mobile application for android devices using the publicly available Android SDK, 
		this software is available on Windows, Mac, Linux, and Chrome OS.</p>

		</p>
		<p class="pt-2">iOS Application – Apple XCode and iOS SDK will be required to build an iOS application, unfortunately this is only available on Mac, to get around the 
		hassle of requiring an apple computer we will build a virtual machine running MacOS. This is called a Hackintosh.</p>

		</p>
		<p class="pt-2">Facebook Platform – to access all the features of the Facebook API and SDK we will need a Facebook developer account which is subject to approval and has a 
		complicated and lengthy process.</p>
		<p class="pt-2">Code Repository – All code will be checked into private repository’s on GitHub, they will be private to prevent public access to our source code which may 
		benefit a competitor, hackers, or make it easier for social media platforms to prevent us running our various checks.</p>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Backend Development – a combination of PHP, JAVA and Python will be used to create the various Security, Privacy and Sharing Setting checks, as parts of 
		these checks will be easier to accomplish using different programming languages and will allow us to use a lot of prebuilt software tools.</p>
		<h6>Tutorial Video Environment</h6>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Open Broadcast Studio, will be used to record our tutorial videos as it allows us to screen capture, and record audio, Adobe Premiere will then be used to edit the footage and 
		insert various extra footage that may be required in the tutorial.</p>
