		<h5>Description</h5>
		<h6 class="pt-2">Application</h6>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">The project is an application for Android and iOS smartphones that will also require external servers for computational purposes. 
		It will check the security and privacy settings of the user's social media accounts, highlight concerns, and make recommendations to improve the safety 
		of their data and personal information. The user will be given links to tutorials demonstrating how to make changes to their settings and navigate the 
		labyrinth of menus purposely designed in a manor to ensure users share as much data as possible by default to allow the company to achieve maximum monetisation. 
		Notifications will be used as the method of keeping users up to date in changes of company policies that affect security and privacy, so they will continue 
		to be protected over time.</p>

		<h6>Social Media</h6>
		<p class="pt-2">The Social Media platform the application will initially support, will be Facebook, with our intended design, we will be able to incorporate 
		more platforms in the future such as Twitter, Snapchat, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and Reddit among many others.</p>
		<p class="pt-2">To authenticate these social media accounts, we will be using each platforms API verification methods to conform to their standards for approval.</p>
		<p class="pt-2">The security tokens generated by these APIs will then be encrypted and stored on their device by our application and only be decrypted and supplied 
		to our external applications when requested by the user, once the external applications have completed the tasks they will automatically destroy the copy of the token.</p>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">If the user were to delete our application these tokens will be deleted by the mobile application after the mobile application revokes its access to 
		their social media platform accounts, ending our access to their social media platform and personal information.</p>
		
		<h6>Security, Privacy and Sharing Settings</h6>
		<p class="pt-2">Using a combination of web scraping and Facebook API calls we will be reviewing the userâ€™s entire profile from zero day (Account Creation Day), 
		and checking the privacy settings on every post, image, video and flagging chain/spam posts they have shared. And suggesting changes and deletions.</p>
		<p class="pt-2">We will also be checking the privacy settings set on individual profile information such as Work and Education, Places Lived, Contact and Basic Information, 
		Family and Relationships, Details about you and life events.</p>
		<p class="pt-2">NOTE: These checks will require the users consent each time, As these checks will not be automatic unless the user schedules these checks, scheduled checks will 
		require the users phone to be online with our application running in the background to allow the API tokens to be decrypted and exchanged with our servers otherwise the task will fail.</p>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Additionally, we will use non-invasive reminders for the user not to use the same password on multiple platforms.</p>

		<h6>Notifications</h6>
		<p class="pt-2">The application will deliver notifications to the user from our external applications or bulk notifications we have scheduled or if we flag a social 
		media platform as having changed their privacy agreements, terms of service, or other related documents, and data breaches.</p>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Occasionally we will also remind the user to run a privacy check-up if they have not run one in more than 60 days.</p>
		
		<h6>Tutorial Videos</h6>
		<p class="pt-2">Tutorial Videos will be web encoded and streamed using a simple html5 video player.</p>
		<p class="pt-2">Each tutorial video will need to be recorded, for both mobile and desktop versions of the website, with closed captions added, long term these will need to be 
		translated closed captions to support additional languages.</p>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">Tutorial videos will be predominately screen captures with voice overs.</p>
		
		<h6>Innovation</h6>
		<p class="pt-2">Possible upgrades in the future to the application would be to leverage the power of AI and machine learning to accomplish the web scraping of the social media platforms, 
		allowing the backend applications to adapt easier to layout changes imposed by the individual platforms, this will also vastly reduce development time on a per platform basis.</p>
		<p class="pt-2">Limited analytics which are limited in the capacity they can store no personally identifiable information, can be introduced to both the mobile application and backend 
		applications to assist in identifying where users are consistently having issues, for example we would be able to know if users are finding particular tutorial videos difficult to follow 
		and giving up, this information would assist us in creating better tutorials. We would also be able to identify what the most common security and privacy issues are on various platforms 
		and publish this information.</p>
		<p class="pt-2 pb-3">With the use of limited analytics and machine learning the effectiveness of our application will hopefully grow at an exponential rate with the user basis and 
		becoming more effective over time.</p>
