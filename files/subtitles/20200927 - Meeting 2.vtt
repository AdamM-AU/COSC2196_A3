dc4d80ec-15ae-4f10-9ec3-0daa23c3ce70
00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.344

00:01:00.435 --> 00:01:03.245
thinking breaking it up into
one person per report, plus

NOTE Confidence: 0.8702834

0df60017-d360-4ec9-96f5-b531021af3f0
00:01:03.245 --> 00:01:05.212

0b3bf358-1931-4aca-b15f-52f086af5cb6
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.442
Because each of these reports is
like 1200 words and I think

NOTE Confidence: 0.86728865

fe54f7aa-56c4-47f7-b63a-f2680a19ac59
00:01:13.442 --> 00:01:15.794

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.777
So we have to do for these
reports, but it's the kind of

4e7beda4-9b90-43b9-abcb-444dde5d3bf2
00:01:27.777 --> 00:01:32.085
low in terms of word count,
so I think if you have

08b0380a-7551-42b3-b19a-7a1200448fb1
00:01:32.085 --> 00:01:35.316

00:01:35.316 --> 00:01:36.393
